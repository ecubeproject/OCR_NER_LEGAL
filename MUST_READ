# One very important instruction is that the app requires precise numpy version to make various deep learning frameworks, pre-trained models and padddle OCR etc. i.e. numpy==1.23.5. 
# As that is old version,  while installing other packages in requirements.txt through Ubuntu terminal numpy is auto upgraded which breaks compatibility with other libraries.

# Here is requirements.tx content
# paddlepaddle-gpu==2.5.0.post118  # Commented out for CPU only setup
gradio==5.38.2
paddleocr==2.6.1.3
paddlepaddle==2.5.0
pdf2image==1.17.0
PyMuPDF==1.20.2
pytesseract==0.3.10
pillow==11.3.0
transformers==4.49.0
torch==2.7.1
spacy==3.8.7
spacy-transformers==1.3.9
pandas==1.5.3
opencv-python-headless==4.12.0.88
huggingface-hub==0.34.1

# So after creating python 3.10 virtual environment proceed as below:
(1) Install numpy==1.23.5  FIRST 
(2) While installing other packages If anything tries to upgrade numpy, immediately uninstall and reinstall numpy.
```bash
  pip uninstall numpy -y
  pip install numpy==1.23.5 --force-reinstall
(3) Then install above packages (one by one recommended) with --no-deps at the endo of command
E.g. 
```bash
pip install paddleocr==2.6.1.3 --no-deps 
and so one for all reamining packages

Installing numpy first, and always using --no-deps, means pip will never auto-upgrade numpy later. This is the standard solution for working with PaddleOCR, paddlex, and layoutparser together.
